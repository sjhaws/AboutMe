                <p>
                    A few years after gratuating from Utah State University, I ran into one of my friends from college.
                    Unknown to her, I had wanted to date her in college but didn't have the courage to ask her out.
                    After a few months of catching up, we started dating and were quickly married.
                    <br><br>
                    We now have a third member of the family, who gets her cuteness from her mother and her stuborness from her father.
