                <p>
                    I graduated from Utah State University with a Business Management Degree focusing on Human Resources.
                    <br><br>
                    For the first 4 years of my carreer, I worked as an HR Generalist at several companies. 
                    At each employer I would find myself working on technology related projects but didn't connect the dots 
                    until working at my most recent company when the IT Director took notice of what I was doing and invited me to move departments.
                    <br><br>
                    Since then I have been working as a BA/Project Manager for a software dev team and learning bits here and there.
                    I'm now looking forward to learning skills to become a more active participant in the team, by helping to build what has been designed.
